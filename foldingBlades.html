<h2>Knife Care / Folding Blades:</h2>
<h4>Q: WHAT IS RECOMMENDED TO CARE FOR MY FOLDING BLADE KNIFE?</h4>
<p>A: Take care of your folding blade knife, and it will take care of you. We recommend keeping your Southern Grind folding blade knife sharp, clean, dry and oiled to defend against wear, corrosion and possible injuries. </p>

<h4>Q: HOW DO I CLEAN MY FOLDING BLADE KNIFE?</h4>
<p>A: We recommend cleaning your Southern Grind folding blade knife after each use. First, using a solution of mild soap and water, remove any dirt or debris. Do not soak your knife or use any harsh detergents during the cleaning process.  Next, dry the knife thoroughly and completely. Finally, using a chamois, rub a small amount of moisture-displacing oil like WD-40 on the blade, this will help prevent oxidation and water spots. </p>

<h4>Q: SHOULD I OIL MY FOLDING BLADE KNIFE? </h4>
<p>A: Give your Southern Grind folding blade knife a light coat of oil after each cleaning and before long-term storage.  Using a chamois, rub a small amount of moisture-displacing oil like WD-40 on the blade, this will help prevent oxidation and water spots. Remember, even hardened stainless steel will rust without the right upkeep.</p>


<h4>Q: HOW DO I SHARPEN MY FOLDING BLADE KNIFE?</h4>
<p>A: For at-home sharpening, we recommend a fixed-angle sharpening kit to create a consistent grind on the entire the length of the knife. First-timers: We recommend practicing your techniques before sharpening your fixed blade, as any knife damage caused by home sharpening is not covered under the Southern Grind warranty.

Southern Grind does offer sharpening services for a minimal charge. Refer to the insert that came with your knife, or contact <a href="mailto:info@southernground.net" target="_blank">info@southernground.net</a> for more information about our sharpening services. </p>

<h4>Q: WHAT ARE THE RECOMMENDED & NON-RECOMMENDED USES FOR MY FOLDING BLADE?</h4>
<p>A: From front lines to tree lines to grocery lines, you&#39;ll find a host of uses for Southern Grind folding blade knives. As portable utility tools, the list of primary uses for our knives is seemingly endless, however, we do not recommend any activities in which you pound, throw or chop with your Southern Grind folding knife to avoid compromising the handle or locking system. Additionally, it&#39;s never really a good idea to use your knife to pry something open, or in lieu of a screwdriver - doing so could compromise the integrity of the blade.</p>

<h4>Q: WHAT IF MY FOLDING BLADE BREAKS?</h4>
<p>A: In the event that your Southern Grind fixed blade knife breaks, please send it immediately to our Warranty Department. After your knife arrives, it will be inspected and tested by our team. If there are no signs of abuse, your blade is covered under warranty and will be replaced at no charge. Review our  <a href="http://southerngrind.com/SouthernGrindWarranty.pdf">limited lifetime warranty</a>  for more information. </p>

<h4>Q: HOW DO I REMOVE THE BAD MONKEY POCKET CLIP?</h4>
A: The Bad Monkey pocket clip can be detached by loosening and removing the three T-6 torx screws.  Be sure to note that the center screw is longer than the others.  The clip is reattached using the three T-6 torx screws in their original screw hole locations using Loctite no. 222 or equivalent threadlocker. </p>

<h4>Q: HOW DO I ADJUST THE BAD MONKEY PIVOT?</h4>
<p>A: The Bad Monkey pivot is loosened or tightened by using the custom pivot tool included in the Bad Monkey <a href="http://shop.southerngrind.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=LJG-SG-110-A" target="_blank">Tool Kit</a>.
