<h2>Knife Care / Fixed Blades:</h2>
<h4>Q: WHAT IS RECOMMENDED TO CARE FOR MY FIXED BLADE KNIFE?</h4>
<p>A: Take care of your fixed blade knife, and it will take care of you. We recommend keeping your Southern Grind fixed blade knife sharp, clean, dry and oiled to defend against wear, corrosion and possible injuries. </p>

<h4>Q: HOW DO I CLEAN MY FIXED BLADE KNIFE?</h2>
<p>A: We recommend cleaning your Southern Grind fixed blade knife after each use. First, using a solution of mild soap and water, remove any dirt or debris. Do not soak your knife or use any harsh detergents during the cleaning process.  Next, dry the knife thoroughly and completely. Finally, using a chamois, rub a small amount of moisture-displacing oil like WD-40 on the blade, this will help prevent oxidation and water spots. </p>

<h4>Q: SHOULD I OIL MY FIXED BLADE KNIFE? </h2>
<p>A: Give your Southern Grind fixed blade knife a light coat of oil after each cleaning and before long-term storage.  Using a chamois, rub a small amount of moisture-displacing oil like WD-40 on the blade, this will help prevent oxidation and water spots. Remember, even hardened stainless steel will rust without the right upkeep.</p>

<h4>Q: HOW DO I SHARPEN MY FIXED BLADE KNIFE?</h2>
<p>A: For at-home sharpening, we recommend a fixed-angle sharpening kit to create a consistent grind on the entire the length of the knife. First-timers: We recommend practicing your techniques before sharpening your fixed blade, as any knife damage caused by home sharpening is not covered under the Southern Grind warranty.

Southern Grind does offer sharpening services for a minimal charge. Refer to the insert that came with your knife, or contact <a href="mailto:info@southerngrind.com" target="_blank">info@southerngrind.com</a> for more information about our sharpening services. </p>

<h4>Q: WHAT ARE THE RECOMMENDED & NON-RECOMMENDED USES FOR MY FIXED BLADE?</h2>
<p>A: You can find a good use for our fixed blade knives in a great number of circumstances, especially when camping, hunting, hiking, etc. Some of the more practical uses include: cleaning brush, fishing, splitting firewood, chopping food..shaving your face (though we don&#39;t really recommend that). Finally, it&#39;s never really a good idea to use your knife to pry something open, doing so could compromise the integrity of the blade.</p>

<h4>Q: HOW SHOULD I STORE MY FIXED BLADE KNIFE?</h2> 
<p>A: When not in use, oil your blade and store it in a cardboard sheath in a temperate environment with low humidity. Storing your knife with a desiccant can also help remove moisture from the air. For long-term storage, we recommend re-oiling your blade two to three times per year to further prevent oxidation.</p>

<h4>Q: WHAT IF MY FIXED BLADE BREAKS?</h2>
<p>A: In the event that your Southern Grind fixed blade knife breaks, please send it immediately to our Warranty Department. After your knife arrives, it will be inspected and tested by our team. If there are no signs of abuse, your blade is covered under warranty and will be replaced at no charge.
