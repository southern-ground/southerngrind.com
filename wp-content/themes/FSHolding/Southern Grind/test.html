for our knives is seemingly endless, however, we do not recommend any activities in which you pound, throw or chop with your Southern Grind folding knife to avoid compromising the handle or locking system. Additionally, it’s never really a good idea to use your knife to pry something open, or in lieu of a screwdriver - doing so could compromise the integrity of the blade.

Q: WHAT IF MY FOLDING BLADE BREAKS?
A: In the event that your Southern Grind fixed blade knife breaks, please send it immediately to our Warranty Department. After your knife arrives, it will be inspected and tested by our team. If there are no signs of abuse, your blade is covered under warranty and will be replaced at no charge. Review our limited lifetime warranty for more information. 

Q: HOW DO I GET A NEW POCKET CLIP?
A: Southern Grind offers replacement pocket clips for just $10.00. Go here to purchase yours.

Q: HOW DO I REMOVE THE BAD MONKEY POCKET CLIP?
A: The Bad Monkey pocket clip can be detached by loosening and removing the three T-6 torx screws.  Be sure to note that the center screw is longer than the others.  The clip is reattached using the three T-6 torx screws in their original screw hole locations using Loctite no. 222 or equivalent threadlocker. 

Q: HOW DO I ADJUST THE BAD MONKEY PIVOT?
A: The Bad Monkey pivot is loosened or tightened by using the custom pivot tool included in the Bad Monkey Tool Kit.  The only side of the pivot that may be adjusted is the blank side of the pivot (not the side with the etched Bad Monkey logo).
